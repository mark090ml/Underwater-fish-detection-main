# Object Detection  

![intro-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55437218/184209758-0e15cece-5d9f-4c5a-bdb9-3282f691ea4c.png)

**Object detection** an important computer vision task of locating and detecting the objects present in the image/video.

On a bit of googling, I was able to find some methods which are capable of doing such a complex task 
* R-CNN
* Mask R-CNN
* Faster R-CNN
* SSD (Single shot detectors)
* YOLO (You only look once)

Out of which I tried to understand R-CNN and YOLO architecture.

On more research it was found that the Yolo seems to have become a standard when it comes to object detection w.r.t. speed and the accuracy  
e.g. take a look at [this](https://youtu.be/NM6lrxy0bxs?t=114) CVPR presentation where he demonstrates different methods and their results in real time 

and can you guess who won the race ?

Here are some resources which I found useful to understand these concepts :

# Project 

In this project, I'll be creating an object detection model which can detect fish species in the sea which may help us to monitor the aquatic life  

Here's link to the dataset which I'll be using for this task : https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/fish

Here's a github repo which contains a list of other datasets as well : https://github.com/alzayats/fish-datasets
